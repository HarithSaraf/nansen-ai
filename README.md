# GreenGenie
This is a GPT-3.5 based LLM application made for the purpose of assisting with Climate Change and Weather Forecasting fundamentally and broadly for anything that's good for us and our environment. Have fun with it until our API tokens get exhausted or maybe use our code and create your own genie :)

## How to use it?

Pretty easy I guess you can just [Click Here to Try the latest GreenGenie](https://sankalpkarthi3-streamlit-prompt-ws-gptbot-c8ccvy.streamlit.app/)

## Example Runs below

In the above image you can notice that it is working perfectly fine for a weathercasting application that runs on the data which was cutoff on September of 2021.

When we asked about crypto-mining GreenGeenie gives us a reply different from what a general LLM like ChatGPT gives, this reply is more towards the foundations we're based upon which you can clearly notice in the 2nd paragraph.

When we asked our kid about who's Shah Rukh Khan("King of Bollywood") it introduces us to him by telling the basics and about how he has influenced our environment/ecology.

## How to run it locally?

- Install the dependancies in the `requirements.txt`.
- Now make the `last_strike_cg.py` available locally.
- Get your Open AI and Cohere API key tokens ready!!
- Now open your terminal and create a `.streamlit` directory in your home(~) directory.
- Create a `secrets.toml` file in `.streamlit` and add all the API tokens in there if you want the keys to be secret which is a good habit.
- Now download the `config.toml` file in this repository and add it int the same directory.
- Now you can just use `streamlit run last_strike_cg.py` to run it.
- Most important part of all, if it doesn't work get back to us on sankalpkarthi3@gmail.com or in [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sankalp-karthi-a4b5b1215)


It's recommended to implement the above in a virtualenvironment (We used `pipenv` for this)
