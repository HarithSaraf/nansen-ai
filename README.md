## How to run it locally?

- Install the dependancies in the `requirements.txt`.
- Now make the `last_strike_cg.py` available locally.
- Get your Open AI and Cohere API key tokens ready!!
- Now open your terminal and create a `.streamlit` directory in your home(~) directory.
- Create a `secrets.toml` file in `.streamlit` and add all the API tokens in there if you want the keys to be secret which is a good habit.
- Now download the `config.toml` file in this repository and add it int the same directory.
- Now you can just use `streamlit run last_strike_cg.py` to run it.
- Most important part of all, if it doesn't work get back to us on sankalpkarthi3@gmail.com or in [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sankalp-karthi-a4b5b1215)


It's recommended to implement the above in a virtualenvironment (We used `pipenv` for this)
